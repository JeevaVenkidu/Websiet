          <p class="description">
            Hello, I'm Jeeva, a B.Tech Agriculture Engineering graduate with a fervent passion for technology and creativity. My journey into the IT world has been marked by a dedication to self-learning and practical experiences.

            I've honed my programming skills in Java through self-paced exploration via YouTube tutorials, while also delving into the intricacies of operating systems with basic Linux tutorials on the Great Learning platform. Currently, I'm expanding my horizons in video editing with DaVinci Resolve and actively immersing myself in UI/UX design through various online resources.
            
            My diverse skill set and eagerness to learn position me as a valuable asset in the IT industry. Proficient in software such as WPL Soft (Delta) and DOP (Delta), I also serve as the Joint Secretary of the Agriculture Department at Sri Shakthi Institute of Engineering and Technology.
            
            With a blend of technological acumen and a knack for creativity, I'm dedicated to driving innovations in the IT sector. I look forward to leveraging my skills and experiences to make meaningful contributions to the world of technology.</p>
